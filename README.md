    seed phrase. This is why writing methods in backend isn't a good practice until we have derived keys.
    You can only automate your own account and can't have user authorisation. It is recommended to use test account while using write methods.

    You can find the seedHex of your account in your browser storage. Just open https://bitclout.com/ > Dev tools > Application > Storage > Local Storage > https://identity.bitclout.com > users > Select the public key with which you want to post > seedHex'''

print(status)  #200 if transaction was succesfull
```

### Selling creator coin of a user
